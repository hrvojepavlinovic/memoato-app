      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        On your first run, memoato helps you pick a few common trackers (templates) like Weight, Water, and Push ups.
        You can always change goals, chart type, and colors later.
      </p>

      <h2>Templates (starter trackers)</h2>
      <p>
        Templates are prefilled categories with sensible defaults (emoji, accent color, chart type, period, goal, and how
        multiple entries are counted). You can use them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboarding</strong>: shown automatically when you have no non-system categories.</li>
        <li><strong>New category</strong>: choose a template from the Template dropdown.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes (built-in)</h2>
      <p>
        Notes is a built-in system category. It’s always created automatically and <strong>can’t be deleted</strong>.
        Use it for quick daily notes. In the Timeline, each note shows its own timestamp.
      </p>

      <h2>How do I log something?</h2>
      <p>
        Open a category and add a number (or a note for Notes). On Home, you can also tap the <strong>+</strong> button
        on a category tile to quick-add. You can backfill by changing the date before adding.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I edit or delete history?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. Open a category, scroll to history, then edit values or delete entries. System categories (like Notes) can’t
        be deleted, but their entries can be edited/deleted.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I reorder categories on Home?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes. On Home, tap <strong>Edit</strong> to enter reorder mode, then drag the handle to rearrange categories. You
        can reset back to automatic ordering from the same screen.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the Timeline?</h2>
      <p>
        Timeline groups your day into readable summaries (totals and entries) so you can see what happened at a glance.
        Notes show individual timestamps per note.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy options</h2>
      <p>
        memoato supports three storage modes: cloud sync, encrypted cloud, and local-only. Open the app, then go to
        <strong>Profile → Privacy</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud sync</strong>: normal server storage for multi-device access.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypted cloud</strong>: category titles and notes are encrypted client-side before saving.</li>
        <li><strong>Local-only</strong>: data stays on your device.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What’s coming next (Coach Mode)</h2>
      <p>
        We’re exploring an optional “Coach Mode” that turns goals into a small daily plan and a weekly review (opt-in,
        privacy-conscious).
      </p>

      <h2>Where do I send feedback?</h2>
      <p>
        Email <a href="mailto:hello@memoato.com">hello@memoato.com</a> or open an issue on the
        <a href="https://github.com/hrvojepavlinovic/memoato-app" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repo</a>.
