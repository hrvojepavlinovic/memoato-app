      <h1 class="page-title">What makes memoato ADHD-friendly?</h1>
      <p class="muted">Short version: reduce friction, reduce decisions, keep the loop visible.</p>

      <p>
        “ADHD-friendly” doesn’t mean magic. It means designing for the moments where you’re tired, distracted, or low on
        willpower — and making the right action (logging) feel obvious and quick.
      </p>

      <h2>Design principles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low friction</strong>: log in seconds with consistent UI and minimal steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Less decision fatigue</strong>: start from templates and sane defaults instead of a blank page.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast feedback</strong>: charts and totals that make progress visible immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Daily timeline</strong>: review the day by category without digging through screens.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgiving workflow</strong>: missed days don’t break the system — you just continue.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy options (so you can actually use it)</h2>
      <p>
        Some people won’t log if it feels risky. memoato supports cloud sync, encrypted cloud, and local-only storage.

      <h2>Try it</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to see what this looks like in practice, open the app and create a few categories using templates.
        Then check the timeline at the end of the day.
