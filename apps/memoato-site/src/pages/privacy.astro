      <p>
        memoato stores only what’s needed to run the app: your account and the data you log. We don’t sell your data.
      </p>
      <h2>Privacy modes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud sync</strong>: data is stored normally to power charts, history, and multi-device access.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encrypted cloud</strong>: tracker titles and per-entry notes are encrypted on your device before saving to the
          database. You unlock with a passphrase on each device.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Local-only</strong>: data stays on the device (IndexedDB). Switching to local-only wipes server data for that account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Encrypted cloud uses client-side encryption. If you lose your passphrase, memoato can’t recover encrypted content.
      </p>
      <h2>Data we store</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Account details: email and username.</li>
        <li>Your trackers (categories): name, emoji, color, goals.</li>
        <li>Your logged entries: numbers and timestamps (and optional per-entry notes).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Data you control</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can edit and delete entries.</li>
        <li>You can export your data from the profile page.</li>
        <li>You can delete your account, which removes your account and logged data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        We use Databuddy for privacy-friendly analytics on memoato.com and app.memoato.com to understand product usage
        (not to identify you). Analytics requests may be blocked by common privacy tools.
      </p>
      <h2>Service providers</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Cloudflare (DNS, Pages, and networking).</li>
        <li>Zoho SMTP (transactional emails for verification and password resets).</li>
        <li>Databuddy (website and app analytics).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Emails</h2>
