      <p>
        memoato is a minimal habit tracker for people who want results without the overhead. It’s designed for low
        friction and ADHD brains: fewer decisions, fast logging, and progress you can understand at a glance.
      </p>

      <h2>What memoato optimizes for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fast capture</strong>: log in seconds, not minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear feedback</strong>: charts, totals, and a daily timeline you can scan.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgiving workflow</strong>: miss a day, keep going.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy options</strong>: cloud sync, encrypted cloud, or local-only.</li>
        <li><strong>Open source</strong>: transparent code and a project you can self-host.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        memoato supports three storage modes: cloud sync, encrypted cloud, and local-only. Details are in the
        <a href="/privacy">Privacy policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Mobile</h2>
      <p>
        memoato works in the browser and as a PWA (Add to Home Screen). Native mobile apps are in progress so we can add
        things like notifications and a more “app-like” experience without changing the core product.
      </p>

      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Coach Mode</strong>: a small daily plan and weekly review (opt-in).</li>
        <li><strong>AI insights</strong>: optional analysis and feedback on your entries (privacy-conscious).</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile apps</strong>: iOS and Android wrappers for notifications and faster access.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback loop</strong>: make it easier to send feedback and shape the roadmap.</li>
      </ul>
