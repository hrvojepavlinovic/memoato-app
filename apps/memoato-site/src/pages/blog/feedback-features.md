Shipping memoato in public has been the best product decision so far.

The app is intentionally small, so tiny bits of friction stand out immediately. When someone uses memoato to track something real (water intake, workouts, weight), you get feedback that’s impossible to invent in a spec.

## What’s new

### Custom category sorting
Different people care about different things. Now you can reorder your categories so the “important ones” stay at the top, and the rest fades into the background.

### Smarter category options
Categories now have more control, without turning setup into a project:

- **Chart type**: bar for progress, line for trends.
- **Goals**: weekly goals with goal lines (and goals scale when you switch between day, week, month, and year views).
- **Multiple entries behavior**: when you log multiple times in the same bucket, you can decide how it’s interpreted (sum, average, or last).

This matters for real use cases:

- Water intake: sum per day/week.
- Weight: last or average.
- Training volume: sum.

### Timeline day view
Charts help with trends.

But feedback kept pointing to a daily need: “What did I actually do today?”

Timeline is a simple day view that groups entries by category and turns raw logs into something readable. It’s designed to feel human, not like a spreadsheet.

## What’s next
Next up is **dark theme**, also based on feedback (especially for late-night logging).

If you try memoato and something feels off, tell me. The fastest way to improve the app is real usage + honest feedback.
