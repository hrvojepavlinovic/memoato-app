I’ve tried **hundreds** of apps and systems.

Some were beautiful. Some were powerful. Some were “the one”… for about two weeks.

For me, the hard part was never knowing what to do. The hard part was **staying consistent** when my attention drifted, motivation changed, or the novelty wore off.

I have inattentive ADHD. It can be a superpower - I can go deep, connect ideas, and move fast - but it also demands constant work: reflection, course correction, and building new routines when old ones stop working.

That’s why memoato exists.

## The rule I learned the hard way
The best system is the one you’ll still use when you’re tired, stressed, or bored.

So memoato optimizes for:

- **Speed**: log in seconds.
- **Clarity**: see progress instantly.
- **Low friction**: fewer screens, fewer decisions, less “app management”.

If a habit tracker turns into a project, I won’t use it. If it’s a quick tap and I’m back to life - I will.

## Routines don’t fail - they expire
I used to think routine-breaking meant I was “bad at discipline”.

Now I see it differently: routines can be seasonal. A routine that works for your brain today might stop working in a month. That doesn’t mean you failed - it means you need to adapt.

memoato is designed to make adaptation easy:

- Add a category, track it for a while, change it later.
- Edit history without guilt.
- Keep the UI simple so the tool doesn’t become the focus.

## Not medical advice
This is just my experience. If anything here resonates, awesome - and if it doesn’t, that’s also fine. Different brains need different tools.

If you want to try it, the app is at **app.memoato.com**.
