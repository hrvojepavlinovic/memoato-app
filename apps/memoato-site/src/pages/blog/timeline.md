Charts are great for trends.

But for day-to-day consistency, I kept wanting a view that answers a simpler question:

**What did I actually do today?**

## What Timeline shows
Timeline is a day view that turns raw logs into a readable summary:

- Entries are **grouped by category** (so 3 separate push-up logs become one total).
- You see a **time range** for when things happened.
- Weight entries show a simple “weighed” summary (and an average when there are multiple).
- Notes show up as short cards so you can capture thoughts without slowing down your logging flow.

## How to use it
In the app header, open **Timeline**.

- Use the arrows to move days.
- Tap a day to jump there.
- Tap an item in the list to open that category.

## What’s next
Later, this view can become even better with AI-generated summaries (generated once and saved, with a regenerate option).
For now, it’s intentionally simple and fast.

Try it at **app.memoato.com**.
