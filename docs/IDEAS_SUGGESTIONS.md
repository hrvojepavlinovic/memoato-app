## Time precision tracking + goal pacing (2026-02-12)

User intent:

- Track where time goes with very high precision.
- Break down a longer goal into actionable daily steps.
- Know daily if they are on track based on how time is spent.

Possible shape (Memoato style):

- A time-tracking mode where you can quickly switch the active category and the app tallies minutes.
- Time budgets per day or week per category or project.
- A simple on-track signal that compares planned time vs actual time, plus a pace marker throughout the day.

Open questions:

- Manual entry (e.g. `+15 min`) vs a running timer with one-tap switching.
- Single dimension (category only) vs category + project.
- Is “on track” daily only, or also weekly/monthly pacing.
- Any need for idle detection or automatic capture.
