# Marketing plan for X (memoato)

## Target audience
- People who want minimal tracking (ADHD-friendly, low-friction).
- Fitness consistency trackers (push-ups/pull-ups/weekly goals).
- Builders who like open-source, self-hostable tools.

## Positioning
- “Track habits without planning your life.”
- “Fast logging, clear progress, fewer decisions.”
- “Open-source-first, shaped by community.”

## Wasp angle (tagging)
If you want extra distribution in the builder crowd, explicitly mention the stack and tag Wasp:

- Wasp: `@wasp_lang` (confirm handle)
- Founder: `@...` (fill in)

Keep it honest and specific: “one codebase for auth + API + React UI”, “deployable”, “fast iteration”.

## Launch thread outline (8–12 posts)
1) Hook: the problem (tracking apps too heavy)
2) The constraint: speed + minimal UI
3) Demo clip: add an entry in 2–3 seconds
4) Weekly goal charts + weight trend
5) Edit history anytime
6) Works great as an “app” via Add to Home Screen
7) Privacy-friendly analytics (Databuddy) + simple stack (Wasp)
8) “Shaped by community” + feature voting (planned)
9) Open-source soon (invite early contributors)
10) CTA: try `app.memoato.com` + follow for updates

## Images/videos to attach
- 10–15s screen recording: open category → add number → see chart.
- 2 screenshots:
  - Home dashboard with categories
  - Category page with chart + history
- Optional: a 1-slide “principles” image (speed, clarity, minimalism).

## Prepared replies
- “Is it free?” → “Free for now. Open-source soon; self-hosting will be supported.”
- “iOS/Android?” → “Works as a PWA today; native client planned later using same API.”
- “AI?” → “AI helpers planned: smart categorization, summaries, coaching prompts.”
- “Privacy?” → “Minimal data, no ads; privacy policy on memoato.com.”

## Draft posts (copy/paste)

### Draft 1 (launch)
Built a minimal ADHD-friendly habit tracker (“Focus”-style) with `@wasp_lang`: fast logging, clear weekly progress, edit history anytime.

Live: https://app.memoato.com • Landing: https://memoato.com
Open source: https://github.com/hrvojepavlinovic/memoato-app

### Draft 2 (stack credibility)
Shipping memoato on `@wasp_lang` because I wanted one codebase for auth + API + React UI without glue code.

Next: community-shaped roadmap + feature voting.

### Draft 3 (personal story + hook)
I tried 100s of tracking apps. They all died when the routine expired.

Built memoato with `@wasp_lang` to be the fastest possible “log + move on” tracker.

### Draft 4 (ask Wasp community)
Wasp folks: what’s the best way you’d implement an in-app public voting board (ideas + upvotes) in a Wasp app?

## Draft: feedback + shipping (memoato account)

### Post A (single)
Feedback is a feature.

This week memoato shipped a bunch of improvements based on real usage:
- Custom category sorting (put your most important trackers first).
- More category options: goals, chart type (bar or line), and how multiple entries are counted (sum, average, last).
- Better day review with Timeline.

Next up: dark theme, also based on feedback.

Try it: https://app.memoato.com
Built with @WaspLang. Analytics by @trydatabuddy.

### Post B (thread starter)
Shipping memoato in public means feedback turns into features fast.

In the last few days we added:
1) Custom category sorting.
2) Category settings for goals, chart type, and multiple-entry behavior (sum, average, last).
3) Timeline day view (a human-readable summary of what you did).

Next up: dark theme.

Try it: https://app.memoato.com

### Post C (screenshot captions)
Screenshot 1: Home dashboard (custom sorted categories).
Screenshot 2: Category settings (goal, chart type, multiple-entry behavior).
Screenshot 3: Timeline day view.

## Quote tweet (your account, replying to memoato post)
Love this part of building: users point out what feels off, and we fix it quickly.

Category sorting and richer category settings came directly from feedback.
Dark theme is next.
